<h2>7. DATA SECURITY</h2>

<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>8. YOUR RIGHTS & CHOICES</h2>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Access and update your account information</li>
    <li>Delete your account and associated data</li>
    <li>Opt out of promotional communications</li>
    <li>Control location sharing permissions</li>
    <li>Request a copy of your data (data portability)</li>
    <li>Contact us with privacy concerns</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. LOCATION DATA</h2>

<p>Our app may request access to your device's precise location to display your position on the lottery retailer map. This location data is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Used only to center the map on your current location</li>
    <li>Never stored on our servers or databases</li>
    <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
    <li>Never used for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
    <li>Processed locally on your device only</li>
    <li>You can deny location access and the app will still function normally</li>
</ul>

<h2>9A. CAMERA ACCESS</h2>

<p>📷 Our app may request access to your device's camera to enable the ticket barcode scanning feature. This camera access is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Used solely for scanning lottery ticket barcodes to retrieve game information</li>
    <li>Activated only when you explicitly open the Scanner feature</li>
    <li>Never used to capture, store, or transmit photos or images</li>
    <li>Never used to access your photo library or saved images</li>
    <li>Never used for facial recognition or any biometric data collection</li>
    <li>Never used for audio recording, surveillance, or monitoring of any kind</li>
    <li>Processed entirely on your device in real-time</li>
    <li>Immediately deactivated when you exit the Scanner feature</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not have access to your device's microphone through this permission. Granting camera access does not provide us with any capability to view, record, or transmit visual or audio content beyond the specific barcode scanning function. You can deny camera access and the app will still function normally; the Scanner feature simply will not be available.</p>

<h2>10. APP ACTIVITY TRACKING</h2>

<p>To improve your experience and provide personalized features, we track certain activities within the app:</p>

    <li>User Interactions: Actions taken within the app (searches, filters applied, map interactions)</li>
    <li>Feature Usage: Which app features you use most frequently</li>
</ul>

<p>This activity data is:</p>

    <li>Stored securely in our database (AWS DynamoDB)</li>
    <li>Used only to enhance your app experience and provide personalized recommendations</li>
    <li>Associated with your account (if logged in) or device ID (if using the app anonymously)</li>
    <li>Never sold or shared with third parties for marketing purposes</li>

</ul>

<p>Gold tier users can view and manage their tracked favorites and scan history within the app.</p>

<h2>10A. ADVERTISING & THIRD-PARTY AD SERVICES</h2>

<p>Our free and Silver subscription tiers display advertisements served by Google AdMob. To provide relevant ads, AdMob may collect and use certain information:</p>

<p><strong>📱 INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ADMOB:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (advertising ID, device model)</li>
    <li>IP address and approximate location</li>
    <li>App usage information</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW ADMOB USES THIS DATA:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>To serve personalized advertisements</li>
    <li>To measure ad performance</li>
    <li>To prevent fraud and abuse</li>
</ul>

<p>We have configured our app to request non-personalized ads only, which limits the data collection and use for ad targeting. However, AdMob may still collect basic device and usage information necessary to serve ads.</p>

<p>For more information about Google's data practices, visit: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></p>
